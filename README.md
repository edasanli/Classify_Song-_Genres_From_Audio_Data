# Classify_Song_Genres_From_Audio_Data

This project belongs to one of the machine learning projects by DataCamp. The dataset, context and couple of basic instructions is provided in this project.


## Project Description
I will start using Echonest dataset which contains two music genres (hip hop and rock) and will train two classifiers to distinguish genres based on track information. After standard scaling process and principal component analysis (PCA) and necessary visualizations for data exploration is completed, I will use Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models to correctly classify songs genres and compare which model makes better prediction. On the next step I will balance the dataset by sampling the data as one genre has more data points than the other. Finally, I will attempt to do a cross validation with K-fold CV here to see if model performance score is improved with sampled dataset.
